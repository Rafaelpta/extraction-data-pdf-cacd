# Extraction of data in a PDF

This python script is designed to extract data from PDF files and generate a ranking of candidates based on their results in the CACD (Brazilian diplomatic career) exam. 

## Installation

Clone the repository.

Ensure that you have a compatible version of Python installed (Python 3.6 or later).

## Usage

In "app.py", inject the results in "test_str" seen in the original PDF document where the results are issued (normally under the 1.1 topic. Here is an example https://www.iades.com.br/inscricao/upload/303/20220606142252254.pdf).

Run the script and it will automatically extract data from each PDF file and generate a ranking based on the results.

The ranking will be saved in a CSV file in the output_files directory.

## Disclaimer

This is my first script!
